# MabiOPPA
MabiOPPA is a utility tool developed to allow you to enjoy mabinogi's crusader raid content more efficiently and conveniently. It does not affect to the Mabinogi client, since it is completely independent application. There are several useful modules in MabiOPPA.

## List of tools in the program
### RunCounter
RunCounter helps you get statistics on how well your squad is performing, and MabiOPPA's cumulative data analysis lets you know the drop rate of rare items as you repeat the raid. MabiOPPA's interesting ranking system, which will be introduced in the future, will let you know how well the raids you have hosted or participated in compared to other squads. RunCounter reports your raid results. You can copy it directly to the clipboard and post it to your Discord server channel, but you can also use OPPAbot, the Discord bot user of the MabiOPPA project, to post it for you instead. 
### RosterMaker
Coming a month later, RosterMaker is MabiOPPA's most powerful tool. Raid hosts no longer need to configure rosters by consuming a lot of time by looking through the stat data tables of close to 16 users for more than 15 minutes each raid. RosterMaker automatically calculates the most optimal roster with the single touch of a button by comparing exact judgement blade damage with buff and debuffs of more than 700 generated roster candidates, based on the user's stat data stored in the server.
### RaidCalendar
With another future feature of MabiOPPA, RaidCalendar, raid hosts no longer have to go in and out of the Discord servers of multiple guilds or organizations for non-overlapping raid schedules. Check and manage different raid schedules at a glance with RaidCalendar. When you use OPPAbot's extended function, OPPAbot will automatically post raid recruitment posts on your discord server and display a list of signed-up users on RaidCalendar. If the raid time is almost reached and there are not enough people, set it to automatically cancel the raid. The smart OPPAbot will post a raid cancellation notice for you as well.
